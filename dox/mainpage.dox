/** \mainpage Virtual-Move Monte Carlo (VMMC) library Documentation

\section intro_sec Introduction
LibVMMC is a simple C++ library that can be used to perform "virtual-move"
Monte Carlo (VMMC) simulations for systems of pairwise interacting particles.
Our primary goal is to make VMMC accessible to a wider audience, for whom the
time required to code the algorithm poses a significant barrier to using the
method. This allows the user to focus on model development.

For details of the VMMC algorithm, see:
- \ref references

\section compiling_sec Using the Code
For specific instructions regarding how to install LibTPS, see:
- \ref compiling

To get a feel for the how to write a code using the library,
see the demos:
- demos/square_wellium.cpp
- demos/lennard_jonesium.cpp
